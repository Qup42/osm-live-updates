# osm-live-updates

osm-live-updates (`olu`)  is a tool that can be used to keep databases with [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) (OSM) data that are managed by the [QLever](https://github.com/ad-freiburg/qlever) SPARQL engine up to date by using [OsmChange](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OsmChange) files.

The [osm2rdf](https://github.com/ad-freiburg/osm2rdf) tool is used to convert the osm data to to [RDF Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) (TTL).
